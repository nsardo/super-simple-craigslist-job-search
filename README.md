# Super Simple Craigslist Job Search

A work in progress, very basic implementation.

### Current Usage:

To search the craigslist job board of interest in your city for a specific keyword, go to craigslist for your city and click on the board of interest. Example: web/info design. Copy that url.
Replace the url on line 23 with your own. Then to search for titles that include the word "perl" (not case sensitive)...
```
$ perl cljs.pl perl
```
